###  Brightkite_edges.txt   

Brightkite was once a location-based social networking service provider where users shared their locations by checking-in. The friendship network was collected using their public API, and consists of 58,228 nodes and 214,078 edges. The network is originally directed but we have constructed a network with undirected edges when there is a friendship in both ways. We have also collected a total of 4,491,143 checkins of these users over the period of Apr. 2008 - Oct. 2010.
